<h2>Hobbies</h2>

<p>
Something I have realy gotten into lately is fantasy football. <br>
Yes, I know it sounds dumb, but if i win just one of my leagues this year, I can win 1,000 dollars<br>
Which seems pretty crazy to me just setting a lineup once every week <br>
I like a lot of my teams this year but in the long run theres a lot of different things that can happen.
